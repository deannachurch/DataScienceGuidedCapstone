## Big Mountain Pricing Analysis

This exercise was initiated to find opportunities for Big Mountain to increase revenue and/or decrease operating costs for the upcoming season. 

### Questions to address

* What amenities drive value for customers?
* How does Big Mountain's pricing reflect the current amenities?
* Where should Big Mountain focus efforts to increase revenue and customer satisfaction?

## Recommendations and Key Findings

### Big Mountain provides good value for the price

**Recommendation:** Increase ticket prices by $9

### Close infrequently used runs 

**Recommendation:** Close 2-3 of the least used runs and monitor the impact. If no negative impact, close 2-3 more infrequently used runs.

### Vertical Drop is a value driver

**Recommendation:** If there are positive outcomes from the first two recommendations, add a new lift to support a run with increased vertical drop.


## Modeling Results: Value drivers

Top 5 features:

* Fast Quads
* Runs
* Snowmaking
* Vertical Drop
* Snow Making Coverage
* Total Chairs

Note: There was overlap in important features with the other model that was generated, lending some support to these features driving value.

## Modeling Results: Current Pricing Levels

Big Mountain is the most expensive resort in Montana.

The selected model identified **$95.87** as the target price (the current price of $81). The model as a mean error of +/- $10.39. The recommendation of a price of **$90** seems a good balance capturing value and taking the model error into account.

## Modeling Results: Run Closures

The impact of closing a small number of infrequently used runs is negligible and within the margin of error of the model. Starting with closing a few runs initial helps tests the validity of the model.


## Modeling Results: Increasing Vertical Drop

While snow making capacity is a driver of value, Big Mountain is already near the top of all resorts. Vertical Drop is also a strong value driver, and an area where Big Mountain can improve.

Modeling suggests that increasing vertical drop and adding a lift to support this can support a **$1.99** ticket increase, leading to greater than $3.4M in additional revenue.

## Summary and Conclusions

* Big Mountain could likely increase ticket prices with no changes to amenities.
    + Closing the least used runs could provide additional cost savings.
* Upgrading the Vertical Drop could also drive additional revenue

**Caveats**

* This is a preliminary model
    + The mean error is +/- $10
    + How some of the features interact is not intuitive or well understood
* Testing the model with reversible changes is a good first step.
* Obtaining additional data may also be useful
    + Demographics of Big Mountain customers (particularly local vs visitor)
    + Annual customers at other resorts
